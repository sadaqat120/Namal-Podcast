# 🎙️ Namal Podcast System – Software Engineering Project  

## 📌 About the Project  
The **Namal Podcast System** is a **Software Engineering academic project** focused on the **design and specification** of an online podcast platform. This project includes **comprehensive documentation** detailing the system’s **requirements, architecture, and proposed functionalities** but does not include actual implementation.  

The project was developed as part of a **Software Engineering course** to demonstrate the **systematic approach to software development**, covering all necessary aspects of **planning, analysis, and design** for a real-world web-based podcast system.

## 📑 Deliverables  
This repository contains two key documents:  

1. **📜 Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**  
   - Defines the **scope, functional & non-functional requirements** of the system.  
   - Describes **user roles, system components, and technical constraints**.  
   - Includes **Use Case Diagrams, Data Flow Diagrams (DFD), System Sequence Diagrams (SSD), and Activity Diagrams**.  

2. **📊 Presentation Slides**  
   - A visual representation of the Namal Podcast.  
   - Summarizes the system’s **goals, features, and future scope**.
